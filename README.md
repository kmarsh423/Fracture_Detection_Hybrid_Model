# Fracture Detection with Hybrid CNN + Grad-CAM Triage

## Overview
This project implements a **hybrid medical imaging system for fracture detection using X-ray scans from the Stanford MURA dataset.**
The system is designed as a **high-recall screening tool** that combines:
 - A **CNN classifier** to detect the presence of fractures
 - A **Grad-CAM-based localization confidence module** to decide whether th emodel can confidently identify <i>where</i> a fracture is located

Rather than forcing a binary decision, the system outputs **three possible outcomes**:
 - **Negative**: no fracture detected
 - **Positive**: fracture detected by the CNN and the Grad-CAM localization confidence module
 - **Inconclusive**: fracture suspected, but localization confidence is low

This design mirrors real-world clinical workflows, where uncertain cases are deferred rather than misclassified

## Dataset

- **Source:** Stanford MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs)
- **Task:** Binary fracture classification (positive / negative)
- **Labels:** Image-level only (no bounding boxes or masks)
- **Validation split:** ~1500 positive, ~1700 negative samples

---

## Model

### CNN Backbone
- **Architecture:** ResNet-18
- **Initialization:** ImageNet pretrained
- **Output:** Single logit per image (fracture probability)

The CNN is trained with **binary cross-entropy with logits**, using class weighting to address imbalance.

## Hybrid Decision Logic

### Motivation
A CNN probability alone does not guarantee that the model can meaningfully localize a fracture.  
In medical imaging, **confidence without localization is unsafe**.

This system explicitly models that uncertainty.

---

### Step 1: High-Recall Screening

The classifier operates at a **low probability threshold**:

- If `p < p_low` → **Negative**
- If `p ≥ p_low` → proceed to localization analysis

This biases the system toward **high recall**, minimizing missed fractures.

---

### Step 2: Grad-CAM Localization Confidence

For suspected fractures, **Grad-CAM** is computed from the final convolutional layer.  
Two quantitative measures are extracted:

- **Entropy** — measures how focused the attention is  
- **Activated area ratio** — fraction of pixels exceeding $\alpha$

Diffuse or spatially implausible activations are treated as unreliable.

### Step 3: Hybrid Output

The final system output is:

$$
y =
\begin{cases}
\text{Negative}, & p < p_{\text{low}} \\
\text{Positive}, & p \ge p_{\text{low}} \;\wedge\; \text{localization confident} \\
\text{Inconclusive}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This introduces a principled **abstention mechanism**, improving safety and interpretability.

## Evaluation

Because the system can abstain, standard accuracy alone is insufficient.  
Reported metrics include:

- **Inconclusive rate** (abstention)
- **Coverage** (fraction of confident predictions)
- **Accuracy / Precision / Recall / F1** on confident cases
- **ROC-AUC** for the CNN classifier (threshold-independent)

Hyperparameter EDA is used to analyze **risk–coverage tradeoffs** and select a recall-leaning operating point with meaningful abstention.

## Key Takeaways

- High recall alone is insufficient for medical imaging
- Localization confidence should influence decisions, not just explanations
- Explicit abstention leads to safer, more interpretable systems
- Hybrid ML + rule-based logic bridges black-box models and clinical reasoning
