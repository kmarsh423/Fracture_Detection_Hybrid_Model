# Fracture_Detection_Hybrid_Model
This project builds a hybrid fracture detection system for X-ray images using the Stanford MURA dataset. A CNN is run in a high-recall regime to flag possible fractures, while Grad-CAM is used to assess localization confidence. Uncertain cases are labeled inconclusive, enabling safer and more interpretable screening.
